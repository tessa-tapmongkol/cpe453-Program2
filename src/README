Questions:
1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
--> They would deliver the same turnaround time as FIFO when the workloads are made up of jobs that
    either are the same burst length, or where they come in in ascending order of burst length.

2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response
times as RR?
--> SRTN would deliver the same turnaround time as RR when the workloads are made up of jobs where  
    the job burst times do not surpass the quantum so that the isn't any preemption in RR and also 
    when the jobs come in order of increasing size so that there isn't preemption in SRTN.

3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the 
simulator to demonstrate the trend?
--> The wait time and turnaround time both increase as the job lengths increase in SRTN.

4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an 
equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
--> As the quantum increases the response time would also increase. The equation for the worst-case
    response time, given N jobs and Q quantum is Q(n-1) time to respond.
